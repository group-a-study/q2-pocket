#!/bin/sh
# Installed as /mnt/mmc/.pocket/run. Q2 Pod starts it from its Pocket row (a card app, q2-pod's
# patch/addon.c). It runs from /tmp, never the card: the app and this launcher are copied there
# first and the card's copy of this script is left at once (exec), so nothing keeps the card busy
# and USB storage can always take it. The app runs at nice 10, since downloads are background work
# and playback comes first. The loop restarts it after a failure, waiting 5 s and doubling to a
# minute; an exit of 0 (turned off from the Q2, or idle) ends it. Q2 Pod stops it with a TERM to the
# loop's pid in /tmp/q2-pocket; a download under way is kept and resumed next time. An app still
# there 15 s after its TERM (frozen) is killed, so Stop always stops it. While the debug log is kept
# (q2-pocket.log at the card's root, debuglog.go), the launcher notes its starts, restarts and a
# failed copy there, and the app's stderr (a crash's message) and exit codes go to
# /tmp/q2-pocket.err, which the app's next start copies into the log.
